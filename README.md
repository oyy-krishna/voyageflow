# voyageflow
VoyageFlow is a client-side web simulation of a travel booking flow. It demonstrates front-end skills (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6) and includes form validation, smooth-scrolling blog sections, a real-time price calculator, and custom modals — all within a single index.html file (Tailwind CDN used for styling).
